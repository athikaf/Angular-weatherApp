# WeatherApp

## Hi there, Your Friendly Developer here!
Since a lot of us faced issues while developing this project whether it was in the form of finding resources, finding the right API or any other errors, I decided to make this repository public and help you out.

So,

1) <b>Resources:</b> These are in the Assets Folder. Not the same ones, but similar images that look really cool :)
2) <b>API call:</b> Use the Open Weather API from Rapid API. Here's the link-> https://rapidapi.com/KirylBokiy/api/openweather43/
3) <b>Environment Variables:</b> Although these are not supposed to be shared on Github, I have added the folder for you to check out the file and see how they look.

### Some errors that I encountered:

1) <b>ng: command not found (Solution for MacBook OS)</b>

$npm uninstall -g angular-cli <br />
$npm uninstall -g @angular/cli <br />
$npm cache clean <br />
$npm install -g @angular/cli@latest <br />
$ echo -e "export PATH=$(npm prefix -g)/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc <br />
$source ~/.bashrc <br />
$ng --help <br />
$ng --version <br />

Do this for the first time. If the error happens multiple times post this, probably because of some timeout then execute the following commands:

$ echo -e "export PATH=$(npm prefix -g)/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc <br />
$source ~/.bashrc <br />
$ng --help <br />
$ng --version <br />

2) <b>Typescript: Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'</b>

You need to write 'as string' to both the this.cityname and make it as 'this.cityname as string'

3) <b>API Call Exceeded</b>

Now this is a tricky one. Either create another account and change your env variables, or if you're rich enough, change your planðŸ˜‹ðŸŒš


That's it!

I hope this helps. If it did, do follow me on Github.
